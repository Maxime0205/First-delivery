           <p>When you visit Peru, you must go to Cusco, the second largest city of Peru located in the Andes at 3500m above the sea level. In its beautiful regions, you would enjoy a lot of expeditions which allow you to discover the region and its culture. Among them, you can ride in quad in the Holy Valley to discover pre-Inca constructions and the famous "Salinas de Maras". Also, you must go to the "Vinicunca", also named the "Rainbow moutain" thanks to its colours. The hike at higher than 5000m is an unique experience.</p>
